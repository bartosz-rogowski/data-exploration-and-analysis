## Data

All data were scrapped with Spotify API.

Dataset includes 10 studio albums (deluxe versions if possible) and 2 re-recorded studio albums.

There are columns describing songs (title, album, release date, length etc.) as well as numerical data connected with music analysis (loudness, acousticness, energy, valence etc. - computed by Spotify).


## Analysis

Operations made:
* statistics of columns, histograms, percent of incomplete data
* correlation matrix
* outliers detection
* clusterization (with k-means algorithm)
* classification (with k nearest neighbours algorithm).
